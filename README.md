# Example networks for Mesh

Example networks for the [Mesh](https://github.com/hbrouwer/mesh) neural network simulator:

* [boolean_functions](https://github.com/hbrouwer/mesh-examples/tree/main/boolean_functions):
  These examples are taken from chapter 3 of Plunkett and Elman (1997);

* [reading_aloud](https://github.com/hbrouwer/mesh-examples/tree/main/reading_aloud):
  This example is implements the Reading Aloud network of Plaut et al.
  (1996), as discussed in chapter 8 of McLeod et al. (1998);
    
* [english_past_tense](https://github.com/hbrouwer/mesh-examples/tree/main/english_past_tense):
  This example is implements the English Past Tense network of Plunkett and
  Marchman (1991), as discussed in chapter 9 of McLeod et al. (1998);

* [consonant_vowels](https://github.com/hbrouwer/mesh-examples/tree/main/consonant_vowels):
  This example is taken from chapter 8 of Plunkett and Elman (1997);

* [expectation_comprehension](https://github.com/hbrouwer/mesh-examples/tree/main/expectation_comprehension):
  This implements the surprisal model of Venhuizen et al. (2019).
